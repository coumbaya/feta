# FETA: precision and recall results

In this Section we present FETA recall/precision of deduced joins over fedbench queries, produced with FedX and Anapsid.
Each federated query log, is produced by concurently executing a set of queries with the same query engine IP Address.

Summary

[Cross Domain (CD) collection](https://github.com/coumbaya/feta/blob/master/fedbench_precision_recall#CrossDomain(CD) collection.md)

# Cross Domain (CD) collection

Next figures concern the concurrent execution of all CD collection queries (CD1 to CD7).


# Life Scinece Domain (LS) collection

Next figures concern the concurrent execution of all LS collection queries (LS1 to LS7).


# Collection of non-similar queries

Next figures concern the concurrent execution of non similar queries from CD and LS coolections, i.e. queries that have a null resultset for their common projected variables, namely: CD3, CD4, CD5, CD6, LS2 and LS3.
